Changelog
=========

0.13b2
------

- Corrected error messages. Added a dedicated test to be sure it raises
  the correct errors on view lookup failure.


0.13b1
------

- Added the interface `ILookupComponent` that describe a common behavior
  for all the components involved in the look up : `ModelLookup`,
  `ViewLookup`, `Traverser`. The `__call__` method of `ModelLookup`,
  `ViewLookup` and `Traverser` has been harmonized accordingly.
- `ModelLookup` is no longer responsible fro the stack computation.
  This has now to be handled outside of the component and given as
  an argument to the `__call__` method.
- The namespaces now have now exposed markers to avoid mistyping.
- `parse_path` and `create_path` are now in their own module.
- The default view name is now called `default_name` on the `ViewLookup`
  component.
- The lookup method is now called `lookup` on the `ViewLookup`
  component.
