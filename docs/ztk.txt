In order to introduce Dawnlight into the ZTK, we would need
to work on some libraries. 

Some libraries probably only have a light dependency on
zope.traversing and/or zope.publisher, and moving code out of them
(where?)  will help to liberate them. zope.container is a primary
example (freeing it would also free some other libraries that depend on it).
 
Other libraries may have tighter dependencies, such as the libraries
that define ZCML statements. Either we introduce the capability to
access those registrations in Dawnlight, or we entirely rewrite them.

Libraries with a dependency on zope.publisher include (not a complete set):

* zope.container

* zope.formlib

* zope.login

* zope.pluggableauth

* zope.ptresource

* zope.server

* zope.session

* zope.site (through zope.container)

* zope.traversing

* zope.viewlet (uses zope.browserpage too)

* zope.browserpage
